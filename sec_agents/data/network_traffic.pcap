PCAP File Summary:
- Total Packets: 1,247
- Capture Duration: 300 seconds
- Protocols: TCP (85%), UDP (12%), ICMP (3%)

Sample Traffic Analysis:
1. Suspicious HTTPS connection to 185.243.112.89:443
   - Source: 10.10.10.55:49152
   - Duration: 45 seconds
   - Bytes: 2,048,576 (unusual for typical web traffic)
   - TLS Certificate: Self-signed, suspicious CN

2. RDP Traffic Pattern:
   - Multiple connections from 10.10.10.55 to internal IPs
   - Destinations: 10.10.10.100:3389, 10.10.10.105:3389
   - Pattern suggests lateral movement

3. DNS Queries:
   - Query for malware-c2-server.darknet.com
   - Response: 185.243.112.89
   - TTL: 300 seconds (short for C2 infrastructure)

4. SMB Traffic:
   - Attempted connection to 10.10.10.100:445
   - Failed authentication attempts (5 occurrences)
   - Source: 10.10.10.55

Note: This is synthetic data for demonstration.
In production, use actual PCAP files with tools like tshark or pyshark for analysis.
